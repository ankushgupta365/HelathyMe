# HealthyMe

A one-step solution to all your dietary needs.


## Introduction

Due to increasing health problems throughout the world and no solution in sight, we have created a web app that recommends its users whether to consume a certain product or not.

We built this project for the people who want to make a positive change and live a healthier life.

This application helps user get the nutritional details of their dish and receive a recommendation from us on whether to consume the product or not.

We have used Log Meal API to get the name of the dish from the user and then fetch the nutritional details from the database we have refined. The web-application
is built on React, which makes front-end development easier.


We have collected data from user (height, weight, age and gender) and calculated their BMI. From this BMI, we then determine if the
said user is underweight, overweight or healthy and recommend them the dish accordingly. The user will upload the image of the dish
they want to consume, and we will find its name and ingredients and other nutritional information and then base our recommendation.
